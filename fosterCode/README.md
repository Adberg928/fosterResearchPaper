Project files are mostly in folders, I downloaded them all off of our shared Google drive.
Visuals is all of the visualizations generated for our paper and presentations
Feature importance and selection folders are self-explanatory
Results -- education was our first target variable
Results -- subabuse is our final target variable
The two files outside folders are the preprocessing and the SHAP stuff for fairness
Addiitonally, there were obviously more files written, but I deemed these the ones relevant to our final product
